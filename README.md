## About The Project

![Islam3.0-Complete roadmap](https://github.com/alirazacodes/ISLAM-3.0-DAO/blob/main/scripts/assets/islam3.0-dao-main.png)

ISLAM 3.0 DAO is decentralized community of Islamic Researchers and Scholars governed my Islamic laws, protocols and consensus between members of the community. Members of this community will be able to **validate, authenticate** and **sign** the Islamic contents such as videos, nfts, research proposals and vice versa, before it goes to to main chain or mainnet on the blockchain. 

Members of community will have to register themselves with their personal details, occupation, etc. After that they will mint their details on the blockchain and an exclusive membership NFT will be granted to them, after validation of the details, selected candidates (scholars/researchers) will be given with nft-token-access in order to access different features of the platform. 

## Motivation behind the project

The motivation behind this project came into being right after Dr. Israr Ahmad's Youtube channel was taken down by Youtube back in April 2022. Islamic education is a right for every Muslim. It is as much necessary as the food we eat, worldly education that we receive and vice versa. Controlling of information or discarding it or changing it on a basis of some polictical, social cause should be prohibited and should be provoked at all. And that information is not only limited to Islam or the whole world or any other religion. Islam also prohibits spying or using illegal means to change the someone's data without their consent. 

Well the solution to such an anecdote is Blockchain and WEB3. The information stored here goes is immutable. Once it goes on the Blockchain's ledger, no one can change it. ISLAM 3.0 is a reflection of security, privacy and validation of information that goes over the internet. As its a basic human right to have its own privacy of data. ISLAM 3.0 will not only ensure that in future islamic data will be safe but also that no single entity will control it. As it will be controlled and saved by the Islamic scholars, professors and researchers. Whether its Islamic pictures, videos, research proposals, all kind of Islamic data will be save on the blockchain through ISLAM 3.0.

It will also open a gateway to a wide variety of job roles for Islamic students, scholars, as they will be able to interact and understand the modern technologies as well and be able to earn money or incentives through their participation.

## Membership

Those who will become the members of the ISLAM 3.0 DAO community will be awarded with an amazing **exclusive membership NFT** through which they can mint islamic contents through different ISLAM 3.0 sites on the blockchain.
